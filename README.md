# WEB SCRAPING

## The Idea

Web scraping algorithm that reads specific pages of Booking.com (after a initial filter is done) to retrieve specific information about apartments: name, prices, score, reservations, ...


## The Development

This algorithm was created by me (José Pedro Pinto) and has no commercial intentions apart from learning the programing language and used frameworks.


## Tech && Methodologies

The algorithm is created in Python and uses Selenium framework to read the desired pages.
Then it connects via API to Google Spreadsheets and feeds them with the retrieved information.
